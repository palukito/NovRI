Hi Astrid!

Thanks again for agreeing to collaborate. Really looking forward to getting stuck into this project with you!
I've left this note here as an exercise for us both. If you're reading this, it means I was successful in making my first commit to this repo and you were successful in gaining access to it! :D

here are my three wiki links:
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Constantinus_Snellen_van_Vollenhoven (as it turns out, Vollenhoven is credited for "9 genera and 471 species of insects" - not just butterflies!)
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Institute_of_Scientology_Enterprises
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velyki_Perelisky


The idea with Github is that we'll essentially have a cloud location to save our work to. My (rough) understanding is that you will have a clone of the repo saved locally. You'll then be able to make 'branches' off of that cloned repo for you to work on/experiment with, without running risk of losing the earlier version.

You can make as many branches as you want - in theory, you could have multiple branches with in-progress work on different features. If something goes wrong on one branch, it won't affect master or any other feature branches.

When you're happy/have finished work on a branch you can 'commit' it master. From there, you can 'push' to update the original, hosted by Github.

The owner of the repo (in this case, me) can control what changes are accepted into origin through PRS (pull requests), but I don't know if that'll come into what we're doing here. If it does, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it!

That's my - kinda abstract - understanding of version control with Github, based on my experience of working with developers but not *in* a development team. If there's anything there that doesn't sound quite right, please correct me :)

To practise a bit of version control, see if you can:
  - checkout a new branch. Call it `NovRI/Astrids_notes` or something.
  - update this .txt file with your wiki links
  - commit and push your changes so I can see them

Over and out!







Hi Josh! 
I believe I've successfully edited this note :)

Thank you for pushing me to work with someone. It's really important to get out of our comfort zone and try new things. I really appreciate you taking me into account.

To be honest, it's my first time working (and owning) a Git Hub account. As a graphic designer with experience mostly with marketing teams/ad agencies, I haven't worked with programmers as much. So I'll dedicate some time to read about this app and learn how to use it. 

I'm really excited about the next two weeks! I came home telling my husband about our ideas, and he's impressed!! I hope we can continue to collaborate and most importantly, have fun! 

Here are my three links:

I'll try now to create a branch > not sure what that means yet <
