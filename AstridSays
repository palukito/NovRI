# NovRI
Repo for any and all work completed within the November rapid ideation challenge (weeks 7-9)

Hi Josh

Here's the link to the trello board https://trello.com/b/UYPiQ5KP

I hope you got the invite! Please let me know if you also saw the update on your note. 

I'll update the trello board and add the notes from our call. 

Like I said earlier, I'll be working from home tomorrow, so I'll be more available during the day to chat.
